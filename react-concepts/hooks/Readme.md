# React Hooks

## What are Hooks?

Hooks are special functions introduced in **React 16.8** that let you use **state** and other React features in **functional components**.  

Before Hooks, state and lifecycle methods were only available in **class components**. Hooks make functional components more powerful and easier to work with.

---

## Why use Hooks?

- **Simpler code** – no need for class components.  
- **Reusability** – custom hooks can be shared across multiple components.  
- **Better organization** – separate logic for state, side effects, and other features.  
- **Functional components** can now do everything class components can.

---

## Commonly Used Hooks

### 1️⃣ `useState`

`useState` lets you add **state** to functional components.  

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

Explanation

- `state` → Current value of the state variable.  
- `setState` → Function used to update the state.  
- `initialValue` → Initial value of the state (can be number, string, boolean, array, object, etc.).

Summary

- `useState` allows **functional components to have state**, similar to class components.  
- Calling `setState` **updates the state** and triggers a **re-render** of the component.  
- Always use `setState` to change the state value.  
- Can manage **primitive values, objects, arrays**, and more.  
- Multiple `useState` hooks can exist in **one component**.  
- Supports **lazy initialization** for expensive initial state values. 
```

### 2️⃣ `useEffect`

`useEffect` is used to perform **side effects** in functional components, such as API calls, timers, and subscriptions.  

**Side effects include:**  
1. Fetching data from an API  
2. Updating the DOM manually  
3. Setting up timers or intervals  
4. Subscribing to events  

Before Hooks, you needed **lifecycle methods** in class components (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`) to handle side effects. `useEffect` replaces all of these in functional components.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // effect code

  return () => {
    // cleanup code (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);

Key Points
- **Runs after render → DOM is already updated.  
- **Dependencies array controls when it runs:  
  - `[]` → runs **once** on mount  
  - `[state]` → runs **on state change**  
  - No array → runs **after every render**  
- **Cleanup function** → used for intervals, subscriptions, or any manual DOM cleanup.  
- Can replace all **class component lifecycle methods**.
```
### 3️⃣ `useContext`
   `useContext` lets you **consume context values** in functional components without using `<Context.Consumer>`.
   Instead of passing props through multiple levels (prop drilling), useContext lets you access the context value directly wherever you need it.
   
   **All in one block (Syntax, Explanation, Summary):**

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const value = useContext(MyContext);

How To Use
   -Create a context using→ React.createContext(defaultValue)
   -Provide a  context value in parent component → <Context.Provider value={...}>
   -Consume the context value in any child component using useContext → const value = useContext(Context)

Explanation
   -MyContext → The context object created via React.createContext()
   -value → The current value of the context (provided by the nearest <MyContext.Provider>)

 Summary
- useContext allows functional components to access context values directly
- Eliminates the need for nested <Context.Consumer> components
- Makes code cleaner and easier to read
- Re-renders the component when the context value changes
- Ideal for sharing global data like themes, auth status, or settings
```
### 4️⃣ `useRef`
   `useRef` Persist values between renders (like a box that remembers something but        doesn’t trigger re-renders).
   Directly access/manipulate DOM elements (like focusing an input).
  

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);

Explation
 -refContainer → an object with a .current property.
 -initialValue → the initial value of .current.

Example
const inputRef = useRef(null);

Common Use Cases
  -Accessing DOM elements (like document.querySelector)
  -Storing values that don’t need re-rendering
  -Tracking previous values

Key Points About useRef
  -.current persists values across renders.
  -Updating .current does not trigger a re-render.
  -Great for DOM manipulation and storing mutable values.
  -Can be used to track previous state.

👉 So, useRef = A box that keeps a value between renders without causing re-renders.
```
### 5️⃣ `useCallback`
   `useCallback` is a React Hook that returns a memoized version of a function.

   -This means the function is recreated only when its dependencies change, not on every render.

   -👉 Useful when you pass functions as props to child components (to prevent unnecessary re-renders).

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
  () => {
    // function logic
  },
  [dependencies]
);


Explanation
 -memoizedCallback → cached version of the function.
 -[dependencies] → function is recreated only if these values change.

Why use useCallback?
 -Without useCallback, functions are recreated on every render.
This can cause:
 -Performance issues in large apps.
 -Unnecessary re-renders in child components (if they are wrapped with React.memo).


Key Points About useCallback
  -Prevents unnecessary re-creations of functions.
  -Useful with React.memo child components.
  -Helps with performance optimization in large apps.
  -If dependencies array is empty [], the function is created once and reused.
  -If dependencies change, a new function is created.

👉 In short: useCallback is for memoizing functions, just like useMemo is for memoizing values.

```
### 6️⃣ `useMemo`
   `useMemo` is a React Hook that memoizes the result of a calculation.
     It caches the value and recomputes it only when its dependencies change.

   👉 Don’t recalculate this expensive computation unless you really have to!”

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
  // expensive calculation
  return result;
}, [dependencies]);



Explanation
  -memoizedValue → cached result.
  -[dependencies] → if values inside change → recalculate. Otherwise → return cached result.

Why use useMemo?
 -Prevents expensive recalculations (e.g., loops, filtering, sorting, heavy math).
 -Improves performance in large apps.
 -Works best when combined with pure functions (functions without side effects).


Key Points About useMemo
   -Caches results of expensive calculations.
   -Runs only when dependencies change.
   -Great for filtering, sorting, or heavy loops.
   -Use with care → don’t use useMemo everywhere, only when performance is a real concern.
   -If dependencies array is empty [], it runs only once.


```

### 7️⃣ `useReducer`
   `useReducer` is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic.

   -Useful when state transitions depend on multiple conditions or when you want cleaner state management.

   -Similar to Redux (but built into React).

   👉 Think of it as:
“Instead of juggling multiple useStates, let’s have one place (a reducer) that decides how state changes.”

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ACTION_NAME":
      return { ...state, updatedValue: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}


Explanation
  -state → current state.
  -dispatch → function to send actions.
  -reducer → function describing how state changes.
  -initialState → starting state.

Why use useReducer?
   -When state is complex (e.g., multiple values, nested objects).
   -When state transitions depend on different actions.
   -When you want predictable and organized state updates.

Reducer Pattern Advantages
   -Centralized logic → state updates are in one place.
   -Easy to test and debug (just test reducer function).
   -Predictable state flow (similar to Redux).
   -Great for medium/large apps with complex state.

Key Points About useMemo
   1.Best for complex state logic.
   2.Provides a centralized way to update state using actions.
   3.Returns [state, dispatch] instead of [value, setter].
   4.Similar to Redux but built-in and simpler.
   5.Helps avoid prop drilling when combined with useContext.
   6.Great for managing forms, counters, UI states.
   7.Prefer useState for simple state, useReducer for complex state.
