# Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components in React

In React, **form inputs** can be handled in two ways:  
- **Controlled Components** â†’ React controls the form data.  
- **Uncontrolled Components** â†’ DOM (HTML) manages the form data.  

---
## 1. Controlled Component
A Controlled Component is a form input element (like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`) whose value is controlled by React state.
   - React is the single source of truth.
   - Any change in input value is handled through state updates (useState or setState).

ðŸ“Œ Example: An <input> where the value is tied to a React state variable.
 **Example: Controlled Component**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function ControlledInput() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Controlled Component</h3>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={name} 
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} 
      />
      <p>Value: {name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ControlledInput;
```
  - React controls the input value using useState.
  - Every keystroke updates React state â†’ React re-renders with new value.

## 2.Uncontrolled Component
An Uncontrolled Component is a form input element whose value is controlled by the DOM itself, not by React.
  - React does not manage the inputâ€™s value.
  - You usually use a ref to read the value when needed.
ðŸ“Œ Example: An <input> where you use defaultValue and later read the value with ref.
**Example: Uncontrolled Component**
```js
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert("Input Value: " + inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Uncontrolled Component</h3>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} defaultValue="Hello" />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Show Value</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UncontrolledInput;
```
- Input value is managed by the DOM (not React state).
- We use ref to access the current value when needed.

## Key Takeaway
 1. Use Controlled Components when you need full control and synchronization of data with React state.
 2. Use Uncontrolled Components when you need quick forms and donâ€™t require React to manage every keystroke.

## Comparison Table

| Feature              | Controlled Component                          | Uncontrolled Component                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**       | Form data is handled by React state           | Form data is handled by the DOM itself  |
| **Data Source**      | React state (`useState`)                      | DOM element (`ref`)                     |
| **Value Control**    | Value is passed via `value` prop              | Value is read using `ref` or `defaultValue` |
| **Updates**          | Requires `onChange` handler to update state   | Value can be read only when needed      |
| **Predictability**   | More predictable and easier to test           | Less predictable (since DOM manages it) |
| **When to Use**      | Recommended in most cases for better control  | When quick and simple form handling is needed |
